# Further resources

Here I list some resources you can check to perform your analysis.

## PCA

To do PCA on R I highly recommend to use the package 
`PCAtools` from Kevin Blighe: 

> https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PCAtools.html

With this package one can use metadata to customize the PCA biplots. 

To do a pairs plot you can either use the function `pairsplot` from the 
package `PCAtools`or the function `ggpairs` from the package `GGally`. 

## Survival analysis

A very good starter to survival analysis can be found in this page:

> http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/survival-analysis-basics

They describe the basics of survival analysis and how to use the
packages `survival` and `survminer`.

And in the next post, they explain the cox proportional hazards model. 

> http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/cox-proportional-hazards-model

Highly recommend to use this when doing survival analysis, as you get
estimates for your comparisons and confidence intervals.
